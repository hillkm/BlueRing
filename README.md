# BlueRing
A Python-based pseudonymous chat client built on the Tox protocol. Senior Project for UHD BS in Computer Science.
No further development will be done on the project due to its status as an academic exercise.
For a usable Tox GUI chat client, users would do well to use ÂµTox or check https://wiki.tox.chat for compatible clients.

Necessary libraries: pytoxcore
Can be installed with "pip install pytoxcore"

Once pytoxcore is installed, running BlueRingClient.py will begin an instance of the client, with a new ToxID.
The ToxID of the client (necessary to send a friend request) will be shown in an output message.

An in-depth discussion around the protocol, how it works, and what is happening behind the scenes, the final report
can be found in pdf form inside the repo.
